I was trying to find a linear regression program written in objective C to use in a project of mine.
I could not fine a prexisting project, so I decided to write my own. An instance of the class
LinearRegression is called passing it an NSArray of objects that are composed of instances of the
class DataItem which in turn is composed of two double numbers that represent and x and y value.
